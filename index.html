                </h2>
                <P>
                    I'm really happy and lucky to have you as mine
                </P>
                <p>
                    Having that sweet, caring, loving, beautiful and amazing personality is one thing I am grateful and I cherish it alot, a whole lot
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for coming into my life and giving me a new definition of love at a time I had already given up on love. It's been all roses and bliss since I met you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of our different personalities, we're bound to have misunderstandings but none of what we encounter will change my feelings for you but rather, It'll increase my love for you and strenghten the bond we have together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love you Zurielle, from now till forever.
                </p>

                    Roses are red <br>
                    Violets are blue <br>
                    The stars shine bright <br>
                    But not as bright as you do.
                </p>
